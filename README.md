Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for recognizing handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the *MNIST dataset*. It covers data visualization, model training, performance evaluation, and advanced analysis techniques like t-SNE, class-wise accuracy, and heatmaps.

# Goal

Train a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits.  
This is a *multi-class classification* problem.

# Features

- Visualize sample digits and label distribution
- Normalize and preprocess image data
- Train multiple classification models
- Analyze results using confusion matrices, heatmaps, and prediction confidence
- Dimensionality reduction with *t-SNE* for clustering visualization
- Side-by-side comparison of *Sigmoid* vs *ReLU + Softmax*
- Misclassified sample analysis
